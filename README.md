![Alt text](image.png)

This is a calculator web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides various mathematical functions, including basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, powers, factorials, and more. The calculator has a user-friendly interface and supports both radian and degree modes.

## Features üßæ

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition ‚ûï, subtraction ‚ûñ, multiplication ‚úñÔ∏è, and division ‚ûó.
- Trigonometric functions: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan.
- Mathematical functions: square root, power, factorial, exponential, natural logarithm, and logarithm with base 10.
- Switch between radian and degree modes.
- Syntax error handling for invalid expressions.


## How It Works üßÆ

The calculator takes input from the buttons pressed and generates a formula to evaluate. It also allows users to switch between radian and degree modes for trigonometric functions.

The application uses the `eval()` function in JavaScript to evaluate the formula and display the result on the screen. For complex calculations involving power and factorial, it applies additional custom logic to ensure accurate results.
